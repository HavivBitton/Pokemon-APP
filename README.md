# About This Project

     Welcome to the Pokémon Explorer, a React-based web application that
        brings the world of Pokémon to your fingertips! This project leverages
        the PokéAPI to fetch and display detailed information about your
        favorite Pokémon in a modern, interactive, and visually appealing
        format. Each Pokémon is showcased on a card designed to resemble a
        classic Pokémon trading card, highlighting key details such as its name,
        type, abilities, and stats. Whether you're a seasoned Pokémon Trainer or
        new to the world of Pokémon, this application offers an engaging way to
        explore and learn about these iconic creatures.
